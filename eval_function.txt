Eval function used in this program gives the max player: 
20 points if the max player wins with red marbles.
30 points if the max player wins with blue marbles.
-20 points if the max player loses with red marbles.
-30 points if the max player loses with blue marbles.

I have chosen these points because red marbles accounts the score to be twice the number of marbles left and 
blue marbles accounts the score to be thrice the number of marbles left.
